      <p>
        It's been a decade since <a href="https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/Arrow">Arrow</a> was brought to  our screens in 2012. Portrayed by <a href="https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/Stephen_Amell">Stephen Amell</a>, the bow-and-arrow strapping, hood-wearing, vigilante quickly gained popularity and the show established itself as a household name. This success led to the inception of more <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowverse#Television_series">shows</a> tightly woven into the shared multiverse we now know as the <a href="https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/Arrowverse">Arrowverse</a>, spanning across multiple universes with a diverse ensemble of superheroes, supervillains, and super supporting characters we've all grown to super love.
      </p>
      <p>
          With the Arrowverse nearing its conclusion as most of its series have aired their finals, let's take a look at how each show in the Arrowverse uses diverse characters to tackle the social issue of racism and bring us a racially inclusive character set.

        <b><a href="https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/Iris_West-Allen">Iris West-Allen</a>:</b> Although White in the comics, this pivotal character, who is the love interest of the <a href="https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_Allen_(Earth-1)">main protagonist</a> and later becomes co-leader of <a href="https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Flash">Team Flash</a>, was cast as a Black woman for the series, opening doors for more characters to be cast as members of the <a href="https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/West_family">West family</a>.

      <p>
        While I wasn't a regular viewer of this Arrowverse series myself, Supergirl is probably the most racially inclusive, with character representation across all races, human or alien.

      <p>
        When it comes to challenging social injustices such as systematic racism and racial biases, I believe this show takes the trophy.

      <p>
        The <a href="https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/Legends">Legends</a> are a diverse team of superheroes travelling through time  to preserve the timeline. During some of their quests, they travel back in time to some of the most racist historical eras, questioning the social injustices they meet along the way.
